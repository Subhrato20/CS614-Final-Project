**Cloud Migration and Integration**

Below is a concise overview of the key tasks and phases we follow when migrating existing systems to the cloud and integrating them with new or existing services:

---

1. **Assessment & Discovery**

   * **Stakeholder Interviews**: Gather high-level objectives, regulatory requirements, and existing pain points (e.g., performance bottlenecks, maintenance overhead).
   * **Current-State Inventory**: Catalog on‐premises applications, databases, dependencies, and network configurations. Document OS versions, middleware, and any licensing considerations.
   * **Feasibility Analysis**: Evaluate which workloads are “lift-and-shift” versus candidates for replatforming or refactoring. Identify any data residency or compliance constraints (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).

2. **Cloud Strategy & Planning**

   * **Target Architecture Design**: Sketch a simplified cloud layout, including compute (VMs, containers, serverless), storage (object, block, file), networking (VPC, subnets), and identity services (IAM).
   * **Cost Estimate & ROI**: Provide a brief cost projection (e.g., monthly compute/storage costs) for cloud vs. on‐prem. Highlight potential savings from auto-scaling or reserved instances.
   * **Migration Roadmap**: Prioritize workloads in waves (Phase 1: non-critical apps; Phase 2: core business systems). Define success criteria for each wave (e.g., performance parity, zero data loss).

3. **Preparation & Proof of Concept (PoC)**

   * **Pilot Environment Setup**: Create a small-scale cloud environment (e.g., dev/staging VPC) to validate network connectivity, IAM roles, and basic deployments.
   * **Data Transfer Validation**: Test data movement tools (AWS Database Migration Service, Azure Database Migration, or GCP Transfer Service) with a sample dataset. Measure transfer speeds and identify potential bottlenecks.
   * **Security Baseline**: Establish cloud security controls—network ACLs, security groups, IAM policies—and run a quick security check to ensure no overly permissive rules.

4. **Migration & Cutover**

   * **Infrastructure Provisioning**: Use Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, CloudFormation, or Azure Resource Manager) to replicate necessary VPCs, subnets, security groups, and compute instances in the target cloud region.
   * **Application Migration Approaches**:

     1. **Lift-and-Shift (Rehost)**: Move VMs or containers as-is into cloud compute (e.g., EC2, Azure VMs).
     2. **Replatform**: Make minimal changes (e.g., move from self-managed database to managed service like RDS or Azure SQL).
     3. **Refactor**: Rewrite parts of the application to use cloud-native services (e.g., containerize microservices, adopt serverless functions for event-driven tasks).
   * **Data Migration**: Perform bulk data transfer during a low-traffic window, then run incremental sync until cutover. Use database replication or file sync tools to minimize downtime.
   * **Integration Setup**: Configure API Gateway, Service Bus, or equivalent to connect migrated services with any remaining on-premises systems. Establish VPN or Direct Connect for secure communication if needed.

5. **Testing & Validation**

   * **Functional Testing**: Verify each migrated component—APIs, web UI, background jobs—works correctly in the cloud environment.
   * **Performance & Load Testing**: Run basic load tests (e.g., 100–200 virtual users) on critical endpoints to confirm response times meet or exceed on-prem benchmarks.
   * **Security & Compliance Checks**: Ensure data encryption at rest/in transit, validate IAM roles adhere to least-privilege, and run a quick vulnerability scan on deployed instances.

6. **Production Cutover & Rollback Plan**

   * **Cutover Execution**: During a predefined maintenance window, switch DNS records or update load balancer configurations to route traffic to the new cloud environment.
   * **Smoke Tests**: Immediately run sanity checks (e.g., login flow, key transaction) to confirm basic functionality.
   * **Rollback Steps**: Keep on‐premises systems intact until successful validation. If critical issues arise, revert DNS/load balancer to the previous environment and sync any new data back to on‐premises.

7. **Post-Migration Optimization & Monitoring**

   * **Cost Optimization**: Review instance sizing, identify underutilized resources, and recommend Reserved Instances or Savings Plans where applicable.
   * **Auto-Scaling Configuration**: Set up basic auto-scaling policies for compute and managed database read replicas.
   * **Monitoring & Alerting**: Implement cloud-native monitoring (CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, or Stackdriver) for CPU, memory, disk I/O, and critical application logs. Configure alerts for threshold breaches (e.g., CPU > 80% for 5 minutes).
   * **Backup & Disaster Recovery**: Verify automated backups (e.g., daily snapshots), test a restore operation, and ensure disaster recovery playbooks are documented.

8. **Roles & Responsibilities (Condensed)**

   * **Cloud Architect**: Designs target architecture, oversees IaC templates, and validates cost estimates.
   * **DevOps Engineer**: Builds CI/CD integration for cloud deployments, writes IaC scripts, and configures monitoring/alerting.
   * **Database Administrator (DBA)**: Plans data migration strategy, executes initial data load, and handles cutover/fallback sync.
   * **Security Specialist**: Reviews IAM policies, network security, and compliance controls in the cloud environment.
   * **Project Manager**: Coordinates migration waves, tracks progress, and communicates status to stakeholders.

9. **Deliverables (Streamlined)**

   * **Migration Assessment Brief** (1–2 pages): Inventory of existing systems, chosen migration approach for each, high-level cost comparison.
   * **Target Architecture Diagram**: Simple diagram with VPC structure, subnets, security groups, and key services.
   * **Infrastructure as Code Templates**: Terraform scripts or CloudFormation/ARM templates for core infrastructure.
   * **Cutover Runbook**: Step-by-step instructions for DNS changes, data sync, smoke tests, and rollback procedures.
   * **Post-Migration Report**: Summary of migration results, performance comparisons, cost utilization, and recommendations for ongoing optimization.
