**Example**

* If you engage our **Custom Software Development** team under a 3-month contract and log 170 hours in one month, you’ll be billed:
  170 hrs × \$114/hr = \$19,380 for that month.

* If you switch to a 1-year contract for the same service and log 150 hours in a month, you’ll be billed:
  150 hrs × \$102/hr = \$15,300 for that month.
