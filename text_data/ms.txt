**Maintenance and Support**

Below is a concise overview of the key tasks and phases we follow to keep applications running smoothly after deployment:

---

1. **Monitoring & Incident Management**

   * **Proactive Monitoring**:

     * Set up application health checks (e.g., uptime, response latency).
     * Track logs and metrics (CPU, memory, error rates) via a monitoring tool (CloudWatch, Datadog, Prometheus).
   * **Alert Configuration**:

     * Define alert thresholds (e.g., error rate > 5% for 5 minutes).
     * Configure notifications (Slack, email, PagerDuty) to ensure rapid response.
   * **Incident Triage**:

     * When an alert fires, perform initial assessment (severity, impact).
     * Classify incidents as “critical” (system down), “major” (partial degradation), or “minor” (low-priority bug).

2. **Bug Fixes & Patches**

   * **Issue Logging & Prioritization**:

     * Collect bug reports from monitoring, end-users, or support tickets.
     * Triage by severity and assign SLAs (e.g., critical bugs resolved within 4 hours, major within 24 hours).
   * **Root Cause Analysis (RCA)**:

     * Quickly reproduce the issue in a staging environment.
     * Identify the underlying cause (code defect, configuration drift, infrastructure failure).
   * **Patch Development & Release**:

     * Implement fixes in a feature branch, write or update unit/integration tests.
     * Deploy patch to staging for validation (smoke tests).
     * Roll out to production via a fast-tracked CI/CD pipeline, monitoring immediately for regressions.

3. **Performance Tuning & Optimization**

   * **Periodic Performance Reviews**:

     * Analyze trends in resource utilization and response times.
     * Identify slow database queries, memory leaks, or inefficient loops.
   * **Optimization Actions**:

     * Refine database indexes, add caching layers (Redis, CDN), or adjust auto-scaling policies.
     * Update code paths (e.g., batch processing instead of row-by-row) to improve throughput.
   * **Validation**:

     * Run targeted load tests on optimized components to confirm performance gains before merging to production.

4. **Security Updates & Compliance**

   * **Dependency Scanning**:

     * Regularly scan third-party libraries for vulnerabilities (Snyk, Dependabot).
     * Prioritize and patch high-severity issues within a defined window (e.g., 72 hours).
   * **Security Audits**:

     * Conduct lightweight penetration checks or periodic SAST scans.
     * Apply configuration hardening (firewall rules, IAM policy reviews) as needed.
   * **Compliance Maintenance**:

     * Ensure ongoing adherence to relevant standards (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2).
     * Update data handling procedures and documentation whenever regulations change.

5. **Feature Enhancements & Minor Upgrades**

   * **Backlog Management**:

     * Maintain a prioritized list of small enhancements or UX improvements.
     * Estimate effort and schedule these tasks in minor release cycles (e.g., monthly).
   * **Implementation & Testing**:

     * Develop enhancements following the same development workflow (branch → PR → review → staging → production).
     * Run regression tests to confirm existing functionality remains unaffected.
   * **Release & Communication**:

     * Bundle minor enhancements into a regular release.
     * Share release notes summarizing new features and fixes with stakeholders.

6. **Backup, Disaster Recovery & Documentation**

   * **Backup Procedures**:

     * Schedule automated backups for databases and file storage (daily snapshots, weekly full backups).
     * Periodically test restore procedures in a separate environment to verify data integrity.
   * **Disaster Recovery Plan**:

     * Define RTO (Recovery Time Objective) and RPO (Recovery Point Objective).
     * Document step-by-step recovery actions (e.g., “Restore DB from latest backup, redeploy container images, update DNS”).
   * **Support Documentation**:

     * Maintain a concise runbook covering common incidents, troubleshooting steps, and contact points.
     * Update documentation whenever there’s a significant change to the system or dependencies.

7. **Roles & Responsibilities (Condensed)**

   * **Support Engineer**:

     * Monitors alerts, triages incidents, and applies quick fixes or escalates to developers.
   * **Developer**:

     * Investigates root cause, implements patches, and writes corresponding tests.
   * **DevOps/Infrastructure Engineer**:

     * Manages backups, configures monitoring infrastructure, and oversees disaster recovery drills.
   * **Security Specialist**:

     * Reviews scan results, applies security patches, and updates compliance documentation.
   * **Product Owner / Stakeholder**:

     * Reviews periodic maintenance reports, prioritizes enhancements, and approves minor release schedules.

8. **Deliverables (Streamlined)**

   * **Incident Reports & RCA Summaries**: Brief write-ups on major incidents—root cause, resolution steps, and preventive measures.
   * **Patch Release Notes**: One-page summary of critical fixes applied, affected components, and any required user actions.
   * **Performance & Security Review Reports**: Quarterly summaries highlighting optimizations made, vulnerabilities addressed, and compliance status.
   * **Runbook & Disaster Recovery Guide**: A single document detailing backup schedules, restore steps, and escalation paths.
   * **Enhancement Release Notes**: Short summaries for minor feature additions and UX improvements.
