**Custom Software Development**

Below is a concise overview of the key tasks

---

1. **Project Initiation**

   * **Discovery & Proposal**: Meet with stakeholders to clarify business goals, constraints, and high-level requirements. In return, provide a brief proposal outlining scope, timeline, and cost.
   * **Team Formation**: Assemble a core team (project manager, business analyst, developers, QA, UX designer) once the proposal is approved.

2. **Requirements Definition**

   * **Stakeholder Workshops**: Run focused sessions (or interviews) to capture essential user stories, acceptance criteria, and any technical/non-functional needs (e.g., performance targets, security).
   * **Requirements Brief**: Produce a lean SRS-style summary that lists functional requirements (as user stories), non-functional needs (e.g., “handle 500 users concurrently”), and any integration points. Get stakeholder sign-off before moving on.

3. **Architecture & Technical Design**

   * **High-Level Architecture**: Sketch a simplified diagram showing major components (frontend, backend, database, third-party services) and their interactions. Decide on monolith vs. microservices, and choose a cloud provider if needed.
   * **Tech Stack Selection**: Pick languages/frameworks based on team expertise and project needs (e.g., React or Vue for UI; Node.js, Python, or Java for backend; PostgreSQL or MongoDB for data). Document only the essentials: API endpoints, database schema outline, and any security measures (e.g., JWT authentication).
   * **Design Review**: Share this design summary with key stakeholders and adjust based on feedback; get a quick sign-off.

4. **Agile Development & Implementation**

   * **Sprint Planning**: Break approved user stories into small tasks, estimate effort, and prioritize the backlog for 1- to 2-week iterations.
   * **Coding & Code Review**: Developers implement features in short cycles, write unit tests alongside code, and submit pull requests for peer review. Use basic CI checks (linting, automated tests) to catch issues early.
   * **Incremental Demos**: At the end of each sprint, demo working functionality in a lightweight staging environment. Collect feedback and refine the backlog accordingly.

5. **Quality Assurance & Testing**

   * **Test Strategy Summary**: Define what will be tested (functional checks, basic performance verification, and key security validations) without exhaustive detail.
   * **Automated & Manual Tests**: Write quick unit tests for core logic; perform a handful of manual test cases on critical flows (e.g., user login, data save). Log defects and fix high-priority bugs within the same sprint.

6. **Deployment & Release**

   * **Simple CI/CD Pipeline**: Automate builds and deployments to a staging environment. Once smoke tests pass, push to production using a basic rolling or blue/green deployment.
   * **Production Verification**: Monitor key metrics (e.g., error rates, response times) for 24–48 hours; address any critical issues immediately. Keep a straightforward rollback plan (restore previous container/image and database backup).

7. **Documentation & Handoff**

   * **Developer Guide (Brief)**: Include essential steps: environment setup, build/deploy commands, and a short README describing project structure.
   * **User/Administrator Overview**: Provide a concise user guide (common workflows with screenshots) and an admin checklist (deployment steps, backup procedure). Conduct a short knowledge-transfer call covering codebase structure and operational tasks.

8. **Maintenance & Support**

   * **Ongoing Monitoring**: Set up basic alerts for uptime and error spikes (e.g., with a monitoring service or simple health-check endpoint).
   * **Bug Fixes & Minor Enhancements**: Tackle critical issues within agreed SLAs (often 24–48 hours). Schedule periodic check-ins (monthly or quarterly) to apply security patches, update dependencies, and discuss any new feature requests.

### Core Roles & Responsibilities (Condensed)

* **Project Manager**: Coordinates tasks, tracks progress, and keeps stakeholders informed.
* **Business Analyst**: Captures requirements and ensures user stories are clear.
* **UI/UX Designer**: Offers basic wireframes or mockups for key screens.
* **Developers (Frontend/Backend)**: Write code, implement features, and write corresponding unit tests.
* **QA Engineer**: Executes critical test cases and verifies bug fixes.
* **DevOps Engineer**: Maintains CI/CD pipelines, oversees deployment, and handles basic infrastructure.

### Deliverables (Streamlined)

1. **Proposal & Project Plan** (1–2 pages)
2. **Requirements Brief** (list of user stories + non-functional needs)
3. **Architecture Sketch** (simple diagram + tech-stack rationale)
4. **Sprint-by-Sprint Demos & Release Notes**
5. **Developer README & Deployment Instructions**
6. **User Guide & Admin Checklist**
